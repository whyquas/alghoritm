Overview

This project consists of multiple Java programs that demonstrate the use of recursion to solve various computational problems. Each problem is implemented as a separate class with its own main method, allowing independent execution in IntelliJ IDEA.

Problems Implemented

Find Minimum in an Array - Recursively finds the smallest element in an array.

Calculate Average of an Array - Computes the average of an array recursively.

Check if a Number is Prime - Uses recursion to determine if a given number is prime.

Factorial Calculation - Recursively computes the factorial of a given number.

Fibonacci Sequence - Finds the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.

Power Calculation (a^n) - Recursively calculates the power of a number.

Reverse an Array - Reverses an array using recursion.

Check if a String Contains Only Digits - Determines whether a given string consists only of digits.

Compute Binomial Coefficient - Uses recursion to calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k).

Compute Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) - Recursively finds the GCD of two numbers.

How to Run

Each problem is implemented in a separate class, making it easy to run individually:

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

Locate the class for the problem you want to run.

Right-click the file and select Run 'ClassName.main()'.

Follow the prompts to input data as required.

Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.

IntelliJ IDEA or another Java IDE.

Example Usage

Enter array size: 5
Enter elements:
3 1 4 1 5
Minimum: 1
